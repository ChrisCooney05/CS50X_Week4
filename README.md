- **Filter** - A program that applies filters to BMPs
  - Implement the functions in helpers.c such that a user can apply grayscale, sepia, reflection, or blur filters to their images
    - The function grayscale should take an image and turn it into a black-and-white version of the same image.
    - The function sepia should take an image and turn it into a sepia version of the same image.
    - The reflect function should take an image and reflect it horizontally.
    - The blur function should take an image and turn it into a box-blurred version of the same image.
